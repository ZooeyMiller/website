# Cats and solenoids?

Cats and Solenoids is the space we created to bridge the gap between the cats, internet and microcontollers, and help humans having good time learning how to create cool stuffs with electronic.

All of this is of course made with our real goal in mind, fighting CBD (Cat Boredom Disorder) by teaching as much people as possible how to build entertaining new interactive cat toys.

# What can we do for you ?

- organise workshops/teambuiding for conferences and companies teaching the base of electronics and good practices in developpement.
- create customised workshops where we create fun workshop to teach whatever you want your team to learn.
- create interactive installations / customised digital signage.
- consulting for IOT or web project.
