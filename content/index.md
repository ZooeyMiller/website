# Cats and solenoids?

Cats and Solenoids is the space I created to bridge the gap between the cats, internet and microcontollers.

I'm working in the web for 20 years and learn to solder and hack radio even before that, so I looked at the arrival of IOT with lot on interest, so in the last years in addition to some contractor work I ran workshops, meetups, gave courses in university to share my passion for binding the web and micro controllers.

I also started contracting for IOT based jobs mainly doing installations in museums (44 synchronised raspberry pi in "musée des Confluences", web interface controlled DMX scene lighting in "musée de la Voile").

All of this is of course made with my real goal in mind, fighting CBD (Cat Boredom Disorder) by teaching as much people as possible how to build entertaining new interactive cat toys.

I'm also available for teaching less usefull things like connecting robots to your CI and how to make testing fun, or any web related thing (nodejs / html / css / js) even is no cats are involved
