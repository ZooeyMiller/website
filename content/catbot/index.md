Catbot is a simple, robust, efficient tool to fight CBS (Cat Boredom Syndrome) that only require 2 servos a laser and an Arduino in its simplest form

Easy to replicate and deploy, cats love it, and even tolerate that human controll THE LASER (needless to say no one controll a cat?)

It is also a cool toy to learn the basics of Ardino and connect a thing to the interweb

You may want to take a look at the [404.html](/404.html) and tweak the render.

If you need to make adjustments, you can directly alter page layouts in
``src/layouts/``;
small things like the header, footer, buttons and so on can be changed in
``src/components/``;
and for colors and common CSS variables, you can modify ``postcss.config.js``.

_You feel like the base theme is not enough or you just saw something wrong?_
