Catbot is a simple, robust, efficient tool to fight CBS (Cat Boredom Syndrome) that only require 2 servos a laser and an Arduino.

Easy to replicate and deploy, cats love it, and even tolerate that human controll THE LASER (needless to say, no one controll a cat).

It is also a cool toy to learn the basics of Ardino and connect a thing to the interweb
