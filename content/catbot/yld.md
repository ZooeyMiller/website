# Catbot YLD edition
This page is for the first batch of the YLD edition of the catbot. If your box is with a sticker with a QR-Code please come [here][1]


To assemble the frame of the catbot you will need

- all wodden bits from the kit
- the 2 servomotors (the 2 blue ones)
- the laser

## Notes before assembling

parts for this kits are made to snap and fit together without glue, so you will sometime need to force push part together, to do so, apply presure progessively vertically on pre aligned parts.

## Step by step instructions

We start with the top part, take a servo and the top part align servo gear with the top notch of the wooden bit
### step 1
Place this wooden bit on the top of the servo

### step 2
Same thing with the bottom part, servo wire facing upward in the little additional "U" shaped hole

### step 3
Place the 'E' shaped bit in the top notches

### step 4
Now place the top part on the circular base

### step 5
these two bit will hold the turret in place, you may need to force a bit to make these one s fit in.

### step 6
now we place the laser holder, you should have the wooden bit on the opposite side of the plastic gear and fit the gear in the horn

### step 7
insert the laser (the dark grey cylinder in the pict) in the wooden bit

top part is now complete

### step 8
Now we will start the base by placing the funduino on it

### step 9
We will now place the 3 bar that will hold the turret and the X axis in place
there are 3 bars that looks almost the same in the kit
- one with some engraved logo (A)
- another one with the same shape but no logo (C)
- a third one with a space in the middle (B)

Place the bar A with the engraved logo side facing outside (notch on your left) in the last row of holes

![img caption](/assets/build/yld/22.png)
### step 10
Now place bar B, take care that the notches from the two part matches sides and are on the left
![img caption](/assets/build/yld/23.png)
![img caption](/assets/build/yld/24.png)
### step 11
then place the servo, servo gear should be centered, if not turn both bar sides
![img caption](/assets/build/yld/25.png)
![img caption](/assets/build/yld/26.png)
### step 12
Next is the C bar, with the notches aligned
![img caption](/assets/build/yld/27.png)
![img caption](/assets/build/yld/28.png)
### step 13
the two bits are here to reinforce structure, so you need to slightly bend the two outer bar inward, and will need more force to set them in postition
![img caption](/assets/build/yld/29.png)
![img caption](/assets/build/yld/30.png)
### step 14
now put the top part on the base sevo, gear, and you are done !!! ta da !
![img caption](/assets/build/yld/31.png)

you will have some leftover bit, some plastic horn for the servo motors, and some screws.

screws can be used later on, when the catbot is calibrated to keep the servo and the turret in place, to do so use a small screwdriver to screw them un the middle of the servo gear through the horn
